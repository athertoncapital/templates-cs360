# Lab: Multi-Series Line Chart

This in-class lab will help you understand how to generate tree layouts in D3. Specifically, you will visualize the [Java 8 API Documentation Hierarchy](javaapi.json) using any hierarchical visualization technique you desire.

**You should customize something in the visualization!** Do not simply use example code provided on the web and submit the image produced. Decide whether to those the entire tree or a a subtree. Think about which layout seems to work best for your tree. Based on the layout, consider how to use color---you can use the type (directory or file), size, or depth attributes. Adjust how the nodes and/or edges are displayed and styled. *You need to play around with the code to be certain you understand it!*

## Data Source

For this lab, you will visualize the Java 8 API documentation hierarchy:

> [`javaapi.json`](javaapi.json)

To generate this dataset, I downloaded the Java 8 API docs and used Python to produce a JSON file based on the directory structure. I filtered out `class-use` and `doc-files` folders and the `package-` HTML files.

If you want, you can focus on a subtree within this hierarchy. For example, the following JavaScript code will focus on the `nio` subtree:

```
data = data.children.filter(function(d) { return d.name == 'nio';})[0];
```

If you do focus on a subtree, try to focus on one with a decent height and number of nodes.

## Resources

You can find the D3 API for all of the hierarchy layouts at:

- [Hierarchy Layout](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Hierarchy-Layout)

You may also use the code from the tree demo shown in class:

## Submission

Before the end of class, take a screenshot of your final visualization and submit it in Canvas:

> <https://usfca.instructure.com/courses/1558949/assignments/6581924>

This is a pass/fail assignment---you just need to show you produced a tree visualization to receive credit.
