# Final Project

For your final project, you must create a series of interactive visualizations that provide insight into a complex dataset. The only strict requirements are for your project website and video. Everything else provided here are guidelines but not strict requirements.

## Project Website

:octocat: You must create a professional Github Pages website for your project accessible via the link:

```
http://usf-cs360-2016.github.io/templates-cs360/project/
```

Replace `templates` with your MyUSF username. You must submit the above link in Canvas.

Your website should contain the following elements:

- **Biography:** Please include your name, USF email address, major, and a little about your background.

- **Original Dataset:** Provide a detailed description of the original dataset. Link to the original dataset and attribute it properly (refer to the license information where appropriate). Indicate the size of the original dataset (number of columns and rows), and a description of the type of data it contains.

- **Data Processing:** Provide a detailed description of any processing you performed of the original dataset. Include specifics about the tools you used and operations you performed. If you use Trifacta Wrangler, please include the transformation script. Indicate the size of your processed dataset, and provide a description of *all* the columns you choose to keep. Give some indication of the range or type of values included for each column.

- **Motivation:** Provide a discussion as to why you chose this dataset, and what you hope to learn from your visualizations.

- **Visualizations:** Provide clear navigation to all of the visualizations included in your project.

- **Findings:** Include a paragraph about what you learned from each visualization about your dataset. Please include more sophisticated findings than "x has the maximum value". Look for patterns and trends, and describe what those patterns/trends tell you about the data.

Please note you can embed some of this information in different places, but please make it clear where to find this information. For example, it might make sense to discuss the column values on the visualization pages that use them. 

You should have an informative professional website that you are proud of and want to show off to your friends, family, and future employers.

## Project Video

:movie_camera: You must produce a 4 minute narrated video showing off your final project. This video should give a brief overview of the dataset, and show off the interactivity in each of your visualizations. We will watch these videos during the final exam slot for this class. 

:hourglass: It is important your video is as close to 4 minutes as possible (+/- 5 to 10 seconds) so we finish on time.

You will submit this video on Canvas. It will be uploaded to YouTube (private) so we can easily watch the videos. You are also welcome to upload your video to YouTube or Vimeo (etc.) and embed it on your project website, but this is optional.

You can use any software to record the video. For example, you can use the [screen recording](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201066#screen) feature of Quicktime on many Macs. There are many other free options available for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

## Visualization Guidelines

:chart_with_upwards_trend: These are basic guidelines for the visualizations you should include with your project. You will have to choose what works best for your specific dataset. These guidelines can be summarized as follows:

> Make something *awesome*.

This guideline can be broken down as follows:

- "Make" means you, individually, should come up with a customized visualization for your dataset. You can start with inspirations and posted examples, but the power of D3 is the ability to customize your visualization for your data!

- "Something" refers to 3 to 4 visualizations including *at least* one advanced visualization (e.g. multidimensional visualizations like parallel coordinates, heatmaps, or scatterplot matrices, geographic visualizations like choropleths and symbol maps, or graph visualizations). 

- "Awesome" refers to visualizations that are highly interactive (e.g. a mix of details on demand, linked views, brushing, filtering, sorting), have high data-ink ratio, high data density, low lie factor, and lots of context.

I want you to impress me, and I want you to be proud of your work.

## Grade Information

:100: Projects will be graded based on the following rough scale:

| Grade | Description |
|:----: |:------------|
| A | Assigned to excellent projects that are extremely informative and interactive. |
| B | Assigned to above-average projects that are highly informative and interactive. |
| C | Assigned to average projects that are informative and interactive, and meet the requirements. |
| D | Assigned to below average projects that do not meet the requirements. |
| F | Assigned to incomplete projects that do not meet the requirements. |

It is hard to give a more specific set of grade guidelines, since what you do is really dependent on your dataset, and what you want to learn from that dataset. One way to think about this is that it should be more work than any single homework assignment or your contribution on the midterm project.
